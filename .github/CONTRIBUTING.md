## üé® Coding Standards

### Rust Code Guidelines

```rust
// Use descriptive names
struct WorldConstructionSystem {
    voxel_data: VoxelGrid,
    material_palette: MaterialLibrary,
}

// Document public APIs
/// Creates a new voxel-based world with procedural generation
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `size` - World dimensions in blocks (recommended: 32¬≥)
/// * `seed` - Random seed for procedural generation
/// 
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// let world = WorldConstructionSystem::new(32, 12345);
/// ```
pub fn new(size: u32, seed: u64) -> Self {
    // Implementation
}

// Use Result types for error handling
pub fn build_structure(&mut self, template: &Template) -> RobinResult<Structure> {
    // Safe error handling
}
```

### Code Quality Requirements

- **Format**: `cargo fmt` (automatic formatting)
- **Lint**: `cargo clippy` (zero warnings)
- **Test**: `cargo test` (all tests pass)
- **Document**: Public APIs must have documentation
- **Safety**: Minimize unsafe code, document when necessary

### Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each system should be independently testable
2. **Educational Focus**: Code should be readable and well-commented for learning
3. **Performance**: Real-time interaction requirements
4. **Accessibility**: Inclusive design for diverse users
5. **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior across all platforms

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

```bash
# Unit tests (embedded in source files)
cargo test

# Integration tests
rustc integration_test.rs -o integration_test && ./integration_test

# System-specific tests
rustc simple_3d_playtest.rs -o simple_3d_playtest && ./simple_3d_playtest
rustc npc_ai_test.rs -o npc_ai_test && ./npc_ai_test
rustc world_construction_test.rs -o world_construction_test && ./world_construction_test

# Performance benchmarks
cargo bench
```
